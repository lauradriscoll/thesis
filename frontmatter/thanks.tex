First, I would like to thank my advisor Chris Harvey for the abundance of support. Chris taught me so much at every step along the way, from teaching me how to mill parts for our experiments to putting together the final manuscript - it really felt like an apprenticeship. It was also great fun for me to watch the lab grow and to watch Chris grow as an advisor. I will really miss the time we have spent dreaming up the implications of these findings.

There are several other members of the department that have made a big impact on me. David Ginty and Bruce Bean both gave me crucial advice around year 4. It was easy to take that advice from two people that I respect so highly, not only for their science but more importantly their character. David Cardozo has given me great opportunities to give back to the community in various forms of educational outreach. David is also an especially kind and fun loving person that makes you remember to be happy for everything that's going right. In the later years of grad school Chenghua Gu became one of my most important mentors and at this point is one of my close friends. Chenghua has a positive attitude that is infectious. She maintains a freshness with respect to her science, but also to her life that I hope to emulate. David Ginty, David Cardozo, Bruce and Chenghua are all role models of mine for these reasons.

I truly believe that community is the most important aspect of my life and I have quite the community in Boston. First I have to thank the roomies, for taking me in when I needed friendship the most. Thank you Shay, Kotaro, Eric and Noah for being my Boston family. I really feel like we grew up together. It's hard to imagine the past six years without you and the extended fam (Evelina, Jason, Jasmine, Skyler, Jess, Tim, Alex, James and all the other homies). I want to give a special thanks to Willis for his never-ending love and support in these chaotic past few months.

Most of all I want to thank my loving family Camille, Gary and Nancy. My family has always been supportive and encouraging of my academic pursuits. I'm grateful I have them as a grounding force, helping me to not get too wrapped up in all this.
